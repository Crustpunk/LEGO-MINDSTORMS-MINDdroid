        Welcome, droid!
    </string>    
    
    <string name="tutorial_1">    
        MINDdroid is an Android Application for the real-time direct action remote
        control of LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT robots utilizing direct BlueTooth wireless
        connection between both devices - Android phone and your NXT robot and built-in accelerometer
        and tilt sensors found on most Android powered hand-held phones and devices.\n
        No computer or programming needed. Just make sure that your NXT intelligent
        brick is on and has BlueTooth on and is paired to your hand-held device or a
        phone beforehand. In the menu the middle button enables you to connect to your
        NXT robot model. It takes about 2-3 seconds to connect. And it takes 2 to tango...    
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_2">    
        It interacts in a real-time with NXT robot models built to drive and shoot or
        drive and throw or drive and hit or just drive using ports B (left) and C (right)
        for driving motors. By tilting your mobile device down it moves forward.
        Tilting it up makes your NXT robot model move in the opposite direction
        or backwards.
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_3">    
        Twisting your hand to the left, it will make it turn left and twist right - turn right.
        It has an Action button that triggers instant 180° turn and back motor action connected
        to the port A on NXT intelligent brick. It just works with the default and easy to build
        model Shooter-Bot or any other Tribot.
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_4">    
        It will not work with walker robot models like our famed AlphaRex.
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_5">    
        It indicates the direction you are tilting your hand-held device to and the direction
        your NXT robot moves. Short haptic feedback indicates that you just started driving around.
        Having your phone flat on your palm will make NXT robot stop and you can stare into the NXT
        logo. The more you tilt, faster the robot moves and faster the square blinks. Cool, huh?    
    </string>

    <string name="tutorial_6">    
        Because we can. And we think it is fun. Moreover, it will inspire you and many others
        to start building cool Applications for interacting with NXT and Android devices and even
        more cool LEGO MINDSTORMS robots. Because you can.\n\nNow go, try it out, have fun,
        play good and do not forget to visit us at http://mindstorms.com for more news,
        info and upcoming appies and goodies.
